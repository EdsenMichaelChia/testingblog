## Describing myself
I am 19 years old this year and currently pursuing my degree in Data Science at TARUC, Setapak. 
I believe I am a very confident person and I love learning new things everyday.
My motto in life is that, Learning is a lifetime career.


### More About my personal life
I have a cute doggie called **Fifi** which is her short name.

Here's a cute picture of my dog:

#### Coding is my hobby!
Here I will show some code for all of you:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

```
