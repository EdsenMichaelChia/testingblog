## Describing myself
I am 19 years old this year and currently pursuing my degree in Data Science at TARUC, Setapak. </br>
I believe I am a very confident person and I love learning new things everyday. </br>
My motto in life is that, Learning is a lifetime career. </br>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

```
